# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an Angular 18 scheduler application for creating and managing daily schedules with participants. The app allows users to create columns (places/locations), schedule tasks within those columns, assign participants to tasks, and export individual participant schedules as PDFs.

## Development Commands

### Starting Development Server

```bash
npm start              # Start dev server on localhost:4200
npm run start:host     # Start dev server accessible on network (0.0.0.0)
```

### Building

```bash
npm run build          # Production build to dist/scheduler
npm run watch          # Development build with watch mode
```

### Testing

```bash
npm test              # Run Karma/Jasmine tests
```

## Architecture

### Core Data Model

The application has three main entities stored in localStorage:

1. **Columns**: Represent places/locations (e.g., rooms, stages)

   - Structure: `{ id: string, title: string }`
   - Draggable/reorderable

2. **Tasks**: Scheduled events assigned to columns

   - Structure: `{ id: string, columnId: string, title: string, start: Date, end: Date, participants: string[] }`
   - Stored as time-only (hours/minutes) since the scheduler doesn't support fixed days
   - Draggable and resizable within the calendar view

3. **Participants**: List of people who can be assigned to tasks
   - Structure: `string[]` (array of names)

### Service Layer Architecture

**State Management Services** (all use RxJS BehaviorSubject pattern):

- `TasksService`: Manages task CRUD operations and syncs with ConfigService
- `ColumnsService`: Manages column CRUD operations and ordering
- `ParticipantsService`: Manages participant list

**Persistence Layer**:

- `ConfigService`: Acts as the main interface to LocalstorageService, handles date serialization/deserialization
- `LocalstorageService`: Low-level localStorage operations with three scopes: columns, tasks, participants

**Export/Import Services**:

- `ExportService`: Generates participant-specific PDFs using @pdfme/generator, creates screenshots using html-to-image, and packages multiple PDFs into ZIP files using @zip.js/zip.js
- `ShareService`: Exports/imports config as base64-encoded JSON for sharing schedules

**UI/UX Services**:

- `MobileDetectionService`: Detects mobile devices (touch screen + small viewport or mobile user agent) with reactive resize handling
- `LogoService`: Manages custom SVG logo upload/storage with DOMPurify sanitization to prevent XSS

### Key Libraries

- **angular-calendar**: Day view scheduler with drag-and-drop and resize
- **@ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap**: Modal dialogs
- **@pdfme/generator**: PDF generation for participant schedules
- **html-to-image**: Screenshot capture of the schedule
- **@zip.js/zip.js**: Bundling multiple PDFs into a zip file
- **date-fns**: Date manipulation
- **dompurify**: SVG sanitization for logo uploads
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first styling

### Important Technical Details

1. **Time-Only Scheduling**: Tasks are stored as hours/minutes only because angular-calendar-scheduler doesn't support fixed-day scheduling. Dates are always set to "today" when rendering.

2. **Component Prefix**: Use `sch-` prefix for all component selectors (configured in angular.json).

3. **Drag and Drop**:

   - Columns use Angular CDK drag-drop
   - Tasks use angular-calendar's built-in drag/resize

4. **Export Functionality**:

   - Whole schedule: Screenshot as PNG
   - Per participant: Filtered schedules as PDFs in a ZIP file
   - Share: Base64-encoded JSON config for import/export

5. **Localization**: Spanish locale (es) registered for date formatting.

6. **Styles**: TailwindCSS with custom colors defined in tailwind.config.js. Use tailwind classes but if theres a complex style, create component-specific SCSS files.

## Future Development Notes

From README.md future features:

- Refactor the whole codebase
- Add websockets support (for real-time collaboration)
- Add proper alerts and error handling

Known TODO comments in code:

- Add schema validations for localStorage data (localstorage.service.ts:93)
